# FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

## Why Does This Repository Appear In My Browser Console Log?

This message, which might appear as a 404 error, may be caused by the [Adobe Acrobat Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/adobe-acrobat-pdf-edit-co/efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj). The request originated from a now-removed blocklist integration in the extension. It was not injected â€” it was intentionally used but lacked proper caching. **Adobe resolved the issue** in their update (`v25.6.1.3`) on `June 16, 2025`. You can find more context here: ðŸ”— [Repository Now Limited by GitHub â€“ Hereâ€™s Why](https://github.com/Bon-Appetit/porn-domains/discussions/70)

Please update the extension to fix this issue.
