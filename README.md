## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

### ‚ùå No Guarantee

We do not guarantee the list is 100% accurate, complete, or up to date. Use it at your own discretion. Some sites may slip through, and some sites included here may eventually become non-pornographic.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Local Laws & Definitions

Definitions of ‚Äúpornographic‚Äù or ‚Äúsexually explicit‚Äù vary by jurisdiction. We apply a broad, common-sense definition aligned with typical ‚Äúadult content‚Äù standards. Users are responsible for ensuring they comply with local regulations or corporate policies.

### üõ°Ô∏è Usage & Liability

This is not a definitive or comprehensive list of all adult domains. By using it, you acknowledge that false positives (innocent domains being blocked) and false negatives (porn sites not yet included) may occur. You assume all risks associated with over-blocking or under-blocking. The maintainers are not liable for any damages or losses resulting from your use of this list.
